Project Justifcation
  
Delegation of project tasks is an essential part of any IT project. If team members are not explicitly given tasks, they do not 
make progress on the project and their strengths are wasted. By building a web application that facilitates this process for IT teams,
we will improve the productivity of the team. Task delegation will no longer be a confusing process. Users will be able to check an app
and know what they have to work on just like how they check Facebook

Project Scope

This project will consist of creating a content management system from IT project tasks. The project
will be completed by November 1, 2015. The application will include a way from authenticated users to add, update, delete, create ad filter tasks. 
In addition, these users will be able to add other users and create groups that the tasks will fall under. Other added users can then be assigned a 
group and then given tasks.

Project Deliverables:

Scope Statement
Weekly Progress Reports from Each Developer
Complete Software Package
Test Results From a Sample User Group

Project Success: 

The Project will be successful if the application is used by Upper-Level College Students to plan group IT projects.
